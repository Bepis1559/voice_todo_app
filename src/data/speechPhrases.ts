  'Hi there ! This is your voice to do app. There are a few things to know before you start. To start adding tasks to a specific day , you should say the day and then the task , for example Monday cooking. You also have the option , like , "Monday all" , so all tasks can be read back to you. Please use this option rather often , as mistakes can happen. You can also remove a single task by saying , for example , "Monday remove cooking " . You can remove all the tasks for a day by saying, for example ,  "Monday reset"';
